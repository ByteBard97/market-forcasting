## Summary

### ✅ What We Built (18 slides)
- **Complete story arc:** Challenge → Synthetic Data → Composition → Prophet → Results
- **Core narrative:** Focused, business-relevant, appropriate for shoe executive
- **Key innovation:** Added SineWaveAdditionSlide for visual intuition
- **Reused working slides:** Leveraged existing proven components
- **Composition approach:** Switched to additive (easier to understand)

### ❌ What's Missing from Original Plan

#### High-Value Missing Slides:
1. **Price Elasticity Slide** (Slide 10) - Interactive slider showing price vs demand
2. **Data Leakage Lesson** (Slide 27) - Great story about validation
3. **Prophet's Decomposition** (Slides 20-22) - How Prophet actually works

#### Lower Priority Missing:
- Promotional Windows (can combine with holidays)
- Traffic Signal (less interesting for executive)
- Competitor Events (add complexity)
- Weather Effects (minor factor)
- Viral Moments (covered by drops/hype)
- Modern ML methods (Act 6) - extension planned for later

### ⭐ What We Added (Not in Plan):
- **SineWaveAdditionSlide** - Interactive wave addition (your request!)
  - Shows visual intuition for how sine waves add pointwise
  - Live animation with 3 harmonics
  - Perfect for teaching seasonality intuitively

---

## Key Differences: Plan vs Built

### 1. **Composition Model**
- **Plan:** Multiplicative (`baseline × weekly × yearly × ...`)
- **Built:** Additive (`baseline + weekly + yearly + ...`)
- **Reason:** You requested additive for easier understanding

### 2. **Slide Count**
- **Plan:** 34 slides (comprehensive, academic)
- **Built:** 18 slides (focused, executive-friendly)
- **Reason:** Appropriate for landlord (shoe guy, not data scientist)

### 3. **Technical Depth**
- **Plan:** Deep dive on Fourier, changepoints, neural networks
- **Built:** Business-focused, lighter on math
- **Reason:** "Too much information for a shoe product guy"

### 4. **Interactive Elements**
- **Plan:** Price slider, component toggles, Manim animations
- **Built:** Live sine wave animation, existing charts
- **Reason:** Started with core deck, interactives can be added

---

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Current Deck is Ready ✅
The 18-slide deck we built is:
- **Complete narrative**
- **Appropriate depth** for shoe executive
- **Production-ready** (test with `npm run dev`)
- **Visually engaging** (sine wave animation, charts, backgrounds)

### Phase 2: High-Value Additions (Optional)
If you want to enhance before showing landlord:

1. **Add Price Elasticity Slide** (30 min)
   - Interactive slider showing price → demand relationship
   - Very engaging, hands-on
   - Business-relevant

2. **Add Data Leakage Slide** (15 min)
   - Great story about catching cheating models
   - Shows rigor/validation mindset
   - Memorable lesson

3. **Enhance Prophet Explanation** (45 min)
   - Add decomposition slide (trend + seasonality + holidays)
   - Show how Prophet "sees" the components
   - Makes Prophet less of a black box

### Phase 3: Extended Version (Later)
Act 6 (Modern approaches) for if landlord wants more:
- TimeGPT
- Neural networks
- When to use what

---

## What to Do Next

### Option A: Ship Current Deck ✅ (Recommended)
- Test it: `npm run dev`
- Fix any bugs
- Practice presenting
- Show landlord

**Why:** 18 slides is perfect for a 20-30 min presentation. Complete story. Appropriate depth.

### Option B: Add 3 High-Value Slides First
1. Price Elasticity (interactive)
2. Data Leakage (story)
3. Prophet Decomposition (clarity)

Then ship (21 slides total)

**Why:** These 3 add significant value without overwhelming

### Option C: Build Comprehensive Plan
- Create all 34 slides from plan
- Multiple Manim animations
- All interactive elements
- Extended modern ML section

**Why:** Only if landlord is highly technical or wants teaching material

---

## My Recommendation

**Ship the 18-slide deck we just built.**

It's:
- ✅ Complete story
- ✅ Right depth for shoe executive
- ✅ Visually engaging
- ✅ Has the sine wave animation you wanted
- ✅ Shows convolution (existing video)
- ✅ Demonstrates "vibe coding"
- ✅ Production-ready

The original 34-slide plan was comprehensive but too academic for "a shoe product guy who isn't a data scientist."

**Test it first, then decide if you want to add the 3 high-value slides.**
