Got it 👍 — you want a **dual-audience deck**: engineers (who care about topology, data handling, metrics, losses) and MBAs (who care about accuracy, \$\$ impact, trust, scenarios). Think of it like a **two-layer narrative**: technical depth in the background, business takeaways in the foreground.

Here’s a structure you could feed into Claude Opus (or any slide builder) to get that **beautiful, interactive slide deck**:

---

# 📑 Deck Outline: Forecasting Models for Business & Engineering

---

## 1. Opening — Why Forecasting Matters

- **MBA Speak:**

  - “Accurate forecasts drive better inventory, staffing, and investment decisions.”
  - “Every 1% error improvement can mean \$X saved per month.”

- **Engineering Speak:**

  - “We’re comparing classical statistical models vs. modern neural architectures.”
  - “Goal: reduce forecast error (MAE/MAPE), increase calibration, add explainability.”

---

## 2. The Data Story

- **Visual:** Before/after cleaning → irregular raw sales vs resampled monthly series.
- **MBA Speak:** “We standardize data into consistent reporting periods (like monthly P\&L).”
- **Engineering Speak:** “Resampling to fixed intervals; flagging anomalies/holidays to avoid leakage.”

---

## 3. Model Cheat Sheet (The Landscape)

- Table/heatmap showing when to use ETS, ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, MLP, N-BEATS, TFT.
- **MBA takeaway:** “Simple models are good baselines, but modern deep nets can capture richer patterns across stores.”
- **Engineer takeaway:** “ETS/ARIMA = per-series; ML/DL = global models leveraging cross-series structure.”

---

## 4. Deep Dive: Two Candidate Approaches

### A) Global MLP

- Diagram: sliding window + features → dense layers → horizon forecast.
- **MBA:** “Think: regression with a twist. We feed in the last 36 months and known drivers (promo, prices, holidays). Model predicts next 12 months.”
- **Engineer:** “Input = lagged target + exogenous covariates. Output = H-step vector. Loss = MAE/quantile.”

### B) N-BEATS

- Diagram: stacked blocks with backcast/forecast, residual refinement.
- **MBA:** “Like a committee of analysts: trend, seasonality, fine-tuning. Each adds its piece.”
- **Engineer:** “Block = MLP trunk → backcast (W) + forecast (H). Residual backprop. Optional trend/seasonality stacks.”

---

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

- **MBA:**

  - MAE in dollars (“avg error = \$87k/month”).
  - MAPE in % (“we’re off by 8% on average”).
  - Coverage of confidence bands (“95% interval is honest \~94% of the time”).

- **Engineer:**

  - MAE, MAPE, RMSE, MedAE, MASE.
  - Rolling-origin cross-validation.
  - Calibration diagnostics.

---

## 6. Interactive Intuition (Playground)

- Visuals like TensorFlow Playground, but for forecasting:

  - Decomposition sliders (trend/seasonality/noise).
  - Model comparison overlays.
  - Scenario sandbox: “What if we add +5% traffic? +10% promo?”

- **MBA:** “See the \$ impact of decisions.”
- **Engineer:** “Understand how hyperparameters (lags, horizon) affect fit.”

---

## 7. External Features (Optional)

- **MBA:** “We can enrich with housing, employment, stock indices — macro factors that shift demand.”
- **Engineer:** “Exogenous regressors (known-in-advance vs realized), aligned at same grain, lagged features, careful to avoid leakage.”

---

## 8. Recommendation & Roadmap

- **Step 1:** Baseline ARIMA/ETS (trust & benchmarks).
- **Step 2:** Global MLP (fast ROI baseline).
- **Step 3:** N-BEATS with quantile loss (state-of-art accuracy).
- **MBA takeaway:** “We’ll start simple, add sophistication, and deliver measurable error reduction.”
- **Engineer takeaway:** “Pipeline built in PyTorch (MPS-accelerated), deployable in a PyQt6 or web UI.”

---

## 9. Closing — Business Value & Engineering Rigor

- Side-by-side bullets:

  - **For MBAs:** better accuracy → tighter budgets, less waste, \$\$ saved.
  - **For Engineers:** modern model architectures, reproducible evaluation, scalable app.

- Tagline: _“One deck, two lenses — same outcome: smarter forecasting.”_

# 🎨 Style / Visuals

- **Split-screen layout**: left = MBA phrasing/icons (\$ signs, % change), right = Eng phrasing (equations, diagrams).
- **Interactive graphs**: hover to toggle MAE vs MAPE; sliders for horizon length.
- **Colors:** business blues/greens for trust, engineering greys for rigor.
- **Icons:** 📈 for metrics, ⚙️ for technical, 💵 for business impact.

👉 Do you want me to actually **draft a slide-by-slide script** (titles + speaker notes + diagrams to include) so you can drop it straight into Claude Opus or Keynote and let it autogenerate a polished deck?
